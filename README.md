# CSK_Module_DigitalIOManager
Module to setup digital IO connectors of the device.
## How to Run
The app includes an GUI to setup and optionally link ports via internal cFlow available IO interfaces.
It is also possible to setup events to listen to (e.g. listen on event and trigger output if notified) and other apps can register to internal events to receive OnChange events.
For further information check out the documentation.
## Information
This app / module is part of the SICK AppSpace SensorApp Coding Starter Kit developing approach.
It is programmed in an object oriented way. Some of these modules use kind of "classes" in lua to make it possible to reuse
code / classes in other projects. In general it is not neccessary to code it like this, but the architecture of this app
can be used as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.
Please check documentation of CSK for further information.
